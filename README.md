As a user, I want to be able to name my tamagotchi. The name should be displayed above the tamagotchi.
I want to be able to select an action of either eating, sleeping, or playing using the leftmost button. 
With the middle button, I want to be able to execute these actions.
With the rightmost button, I want to be able to cancel these actions. 

The hunger, boredom, and sleepiness of the tamagotchi will increase over time, so I want to have to decrease them
by executing the listed actions. 
If either hunger, boredom, or sleepiness hit a certain threshold, the game is lost and the tamagotchi dies. This will be shown in an animation within the box where the tamagotchi resides. 

After a certain amount of time, I want the tamagotchi to age. And at a certain age, the tamagotchi will "evolve" and its appearance will change.
